# Machine-Learning-Analysis

This repository contains final project submission for my Machine Learning course taken in the Fall of 2018 at Seton Hill University with Professor Brad Messner.

This final project tasked myself with personally finding a large amount of data that I wanted to work with, and then incorporating a great deal of data-manipulation and analysis techniques that was taught to myself and the class throughout this course. I chose to use Major League Baseball statistics, and perform utilize 10 different concepts taught during the course, which are all located in the Microsoft Excel document in this repository, along with a Microsoft Word document detailing why and how I used said concepts. This project was my first dive into the world of data and as such is very basic as well.
